## Control


## About this Project

The idea of â€‹â€‹the program is:

_"The project consists of clicking on the numbers and turning on the LEDs corresponding to the numbers"._

## Functionalities

- Control leds through commands performed by the remote control, with this we use programming in C ++ language.
